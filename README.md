In our organization, we are working on two key layers: **Human**-Centric Solutions and **Software**-Centric Solutions. 

Human-Centric Solutions: 
This layer puts human needs, experiences, and interactions at the forefront. 
We aim to understand the challenges and aspirations of people and design solutions that cater to their specific requirements. 
Our approach focuses on user research, intuitive interfaces, ease of use, and enhancing overall user satisfaction.

Software-Centric Solutions:
This layer centers around developing robust and scalable software solutions to address complex problems. 
We leverage cutting-edge technologies, programming languages, and software engineering principles to build efficient and reliable systems. 
Our focus lies in developing advanced algorithms, data processing, automation, and optimization to deliver innovative software-centric solutions.

By combining both Human-Centric and Software-Centric approaches, we ensure that our solutions not only meet functional requirements but also provide an exceptional user experience.
